## ðŸ“ˆ Sine and Cosine Plot Visualizer

This module provides a simple visual representation of sine and cosine functions using `matplotlib`. It's great for math exploration, visual learning, or just tryna create that math addiction ðŸ˜„.

### ðŸ§© What's Included

- `a_replica_viz.py`: A custom plotting utility with a decorator `@show_plot` to automatically render styled plots.
- A main script demonstrating:
  - How to generate evenly spaced points between 0 and 2Ï€.
  - Compute sine and cosine values.
  - Plot them with custom colors (sin in red, cos in green).

### ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the main script (`Sine_and_Cosine.py`):

```bash
python Sine_and_Cosine.py
